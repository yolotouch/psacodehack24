For prototype testing, please use the link: https://psacodehack24.onrender.com

As we are using a free version of render to deploy, it will spin down with some inactivity. If the web application is not responding immediately, please give it a minute.

Please note, since we are using OpenAI API, and some requests involve a large amount of token, the time taken to process will be long (even up to 1 minute)
These include: trend analysis, skills matching in the Course Recommendation section.

For the employee recommendation, it would only work once the trend analysis have been done (in order to generate a dictionary of skillsets needed for the future)

For the job scheduling, we are generating a fake dataset, but it would also work dynamically if we adjust some parts of the code.

IMPORTANT:
For the mentorship, please input the name 'Chad Spencer' as this is one of the name in our generated dataset.
